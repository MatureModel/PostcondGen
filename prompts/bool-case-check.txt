We will give you the code context, function stub and natural language specification (in the form of a code comment) for a specific function.
Please write symbolic post-conditions for the function using assert statements.
Please adhere to the following guidelines:
1. The post-conditions MUST be "Bool Case Check", meaning your post-condition should check whether the return_val equals True or False in certain conditions.
2. When writing the post-condition, only use the function's input parameters and a hypothetical return value variable, which we will assume is stored in a variable named return_val.
3. If the post-condition calls any function external to the program context, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects) such as len, sum, round, abs, count and so on.
4. Avoid using logical operators "and" in the assertion. Simplify the expression by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

The format of your answer SHOULD be:
* [POST-CONDITIONS]:
```python
list of assert statements
```

Write post-conditions for [is_positive_odd].
* [CODE CONTEXT, FUNCTION STUB, AND CODE COMMENT]:
def is_positive_odd(n):
    """Return true if a given number is positive and odd, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_positive_odd(5)
    True
    >>> is_positive_odd(60)
    False
    """
* [POST-CONDITIONS]:
```python
# True Case Check
if n>0 and n%2 == 1:
    assert return_val == True

# False Case Check
if n <= 0:
    assert return_val == False

# False Case Check
if n%2 != 1:
    assert return_val == False
```

Write post-conditions for [{{{function_name}}}].
* [CODE CONTEXT, FUNCTION STUB, AND CODE COMMENT]:
{{{natural_language}}}
* [POST-CONDITIONS]:
